-calculate the number of format strings then retrieve the pointer and length to each format string.
	1- calculate the number of fs.
	2- use the number to allocate enough memory for pointers/lengths.
-using the informations above, resolve each format string.
	1- create a function for each conversion specifier.
	2- each format string will passed to a function based on its conversion specifier.
-build the string by replacing each format string with the resolved result and print it.
	1- use the string given as an arguemnt to fucntion and calculate its length, then subtract and add length of each format string and its resolved result accordingly.
	2- circle through the string and each time you stumble upon a format string replac it with its resolved result.
