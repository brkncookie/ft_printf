# ft_printf
Because putnbr and putstr arenâ€™t enough

## Summary
This project is pretty straight forward. You will recode printf.
Fortunetaly you will be able to reuse it in future projects as a legit function of your libft.
You will mainly learn how to use variadic arguments.

Take a look at the [PDF](https://github.com/brkncookie/ft_printf/raw/brain4main/en.subject_7.pdf)

## TODOS
- [ ] review and comment the code.
- [ ] implement automated tests.
- [ ] fix errors derived from autmated tests.
- [x] finish writing the functions which handle each conversion specifier.
- [x] find solutions to following problems:
- ft_strchr() parses past the format string, because it points to a portion of what is pointed to by "fmt".
- ft_printf parses any format string even if it doesn't respect the format string format.
- [x] implement a Makefile with the ability to link with libft.
## Automated Tests
*N/A*
